Instructions
------------

1. Unpack in the *modules* folder (currently in the root of your Drupal 8 installation) and enable in `/admin/modules`.
mapplic block has one dependency: "dynamic_entity_reference"

2. Purchase! the mapplic jQuery here: https://www.mapplic.com/ and download ZIP file.
Extract the ZIP-File: 'codecanyon-6275001-mapplic-custom-interactive-map-jquery-plugin.zip' (or similar) 
to subdir of the mapplic_maps module:  /modules/contrib/mapplic_maps/libraries/mapplic_maps/
/html/ is enough, no need for the /docs/ folder

2.1 When you like to use the prepared German map controller: Deutschland, Europa, Welt 
- you should copy the germany.json to deutschland.json and translate the names
